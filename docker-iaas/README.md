# Docker IaaS Console

A personal **Infrastructure-as-a-Service** console for Docker — stand up and
manage containers from a gallery of presets in an **EC2-style** interface, with
**disk usage front and center** and reported continuously.

## What it does

- **Launch gallery** — a curated set of "AMI-like" presets (Nginx, Postgres,
  MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Node, Python, WordPress, Ubuntu, …). Pick one, tweak
  ports/env, and launch. Missing images are pulled automatically.
- **Instance management** — start / stop / restart / remove containers, view
  logs, and see live state, published ports, age, and per-instance writable
  disk size.
- **Prominent disk usage** — a host-disk gauge (used / free / total) plus a
  Docker footprint breakdown (images, containers, volumes, build cache) with a
  one-click **Reclaim space** (prune) action.
- **Reported regularly** — usage streams to the browser over Server-Sent
  Events and refreshes every few seconds (`USAGE_POLL_MS`), with a live/stale
  indicator. No manual refresh.

## Architecture

```
docker-iaas/
  server/   Express + dockerode REST API and SSE usage stream (TypeScript, ESM)
  web/      React + Vite dashboard (TypeScript)
  scripts/  dev launcher that runs both together
  Dockerfile / docker-compose.yml  run the console itself as a container
```

The server talks to the Docker Engine API via `dockerode`. Host disk usage
comes from `fs.statfs`; the Docker footprint comes from the engine's
`/system/df`. The frontend proxies `/api` to the server in dev and is served
statically by the server in production.

## Quick start (local)

Requires Node 18.15+ (for `fs.statfs`) and a reachable Docker daemon.

```bash
cd docker-iaas
npm install          # installs both workspaces
npm run dev          # server on :4300, web on :5173 (proxied)
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Production-style single process (server serves the built UI):

```bash
npm run build
npm start            # http://localhost:4300
```

## Run the console itself in Docker

```bash
cd docker-iaas
docker compose up --build
# open http://localhost:4300
```

`docker-compose.yml` mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` (to manage the daemon) and
`/:/host:ro` with `HOST_DISK_PATH=/host` (so the gauge reports the *host*
disk, not the container overlay).

## Configuration

All optional — sensible defaults are used.

| Variable          | Default                   | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`            | `4300`                    | Server listen port                                 |
| `DOCKER_SOCKET`   | `/var/run/docker.sock`    | Local daemon socket                                |
| `DOCKER_HOST`     | _(unset)_                 | `tcp://host:2375` to manage a **remote** engine    |
| `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` / `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` | _(unset)_ | TLS for a remote engine (port 2376)     |
| `HOST_DISK_PATH`  | `/`                       | Filesystem path measured by the disk gauge         |
| `USAGE_POLL_MS`   | `5000`                    | Usage stream refresh interval                      |
| `API_PROXY_TARGET`| `http://localhost:4300`   | Dev-only: where Vite proxies `/api`                |

### Managing a remote host (EC2, another server)

Expose the remote Docker Engine over TCP (ideally with TLS), then:

```bash
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://my-ec2-host:2376 DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 \
  DOCKER_CERT_PATH=~/.docker/certs npm start
```

## REST API

| Method / path                        | Description                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `GET  /api/system/ping`              | Daemon reachability + engine version |
| `GET  /api/system/presets`           | The launch gallery                   |
| `GET  /api/system/usage`             | One-shot usage snapshot              |
| `GET  /api/system/usage/stream`      | SSE stream of usage snapshots        |
| `GET  /api/containers`               | List instances (with sizes)          |
| `POST /api/containers`               | Launch (from `presetId` or `image`)  |
| `POST /api/containers/:id/{start,stop,restart}` | Lifecycle actions         |
| `DELETE /api/containers/:id?force=`  | Remove an instance                   |
| `GET  /api/containers/:id/logs`      | Recent logs                          |
| `GET  /api/images`                   | List images                          |
| `POST /api/images/prune`            | Reclaim dangling images + stopped containers |

## Notes & safety

- This console has **full control of the Docker daemon** it connects to — run
  it somewhere trusted and don't expose it publicly without auth in front.
- Presets are a starting point; edit `server/src/presets.ts` to add your own.
- Adding auth, volume management UI, and container stats (CPU/mem) streaming
  are natural next steps.
